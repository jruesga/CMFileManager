mColorPicker
================================

A color picker is something that has always been missing from the standard
set of components which developers can build their user interface in Android
with. Although there have been a few color pickers floating around on the
internet I never found any that I thought was good enough for use in my
applications so I sat down to write my own. This is the result and I have
decided to release it as open source application for all you developers
out there to use, free of charge of course.
